# DataScape items
An example microservice of the current approach I would take at DataScape.



## Setup

### Docker
To set up Docker, simply run the `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d`
command if you do not want a log of what is currently happening. Be aware that
it takes a while for the Cassandra node to start up.

### Spring Boot

Run the project in IntelliJ IDEA or build a `.war` archive and deploy it to 
a Tomcat instance.
